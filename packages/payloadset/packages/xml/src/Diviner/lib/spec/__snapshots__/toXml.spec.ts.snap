The new platform integrates enhanced data sovereign technologies and seamless usability functionalities to advance more accessible and empowered digital experiences for users to engage in XYO’s DePIN ecosystem and the broader digital landscape.</p><p>With xyOS now available to the public, users of all backgrounds can confidently navigate blockchain-based applications with ease while reclaiming ownership of their online interactions in the process. By placing users at the helm, xyOS initiates a paradigm shift in digital autonomy that can bridge the gap between the complex world of decentralized technology and the everyday user.</p><p>“The beta launch of xyOS is a pivotal moment in our journey towards a more sovereign internet for everyone,” said <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/arietrouw">Arie Trouw</a>, co-founder and CEO of XYO. “It’s unfortunate that our current engagements in Web2 are laced with a level of risk at best and exploit at worst. With xyOS, we empower users to take control of their online data using a decentralized platform that simulates the comfort and familiarity of platforms we’ve come to know, and all while putting their freedom, autonomy, and innovation at the forefront.”</p><p><a href="http://node.xyo.network">xyOS</a>, short for XYO Operating System, represents a new chapter for the protocol, leveraging the decentralized benefits of blockchain technology through a user-friendly graphical interface. Similar to an iPhone home screen or Windows desktop, xyOS democratizes access to the XYO Platform, Protocol, and Network, offering a sleek setup of dApps now accessible with a click or tap. By storing all data locally, users retain full control and sovereignty over their information, with the flexibility to modify or delete it at their discretion. From simplifying node setup (and allowing virtually any device to become a node in XYO’s DePIN) to providing real-time insights into XYO technologies, xyOS is a catalyst for change in the digital ecosystem.</p><p>Key features of xyOS include an array of core and default dApps such as Profile, Settings, System Health, and Name Service, as well as tools like Quick Search, OS Theming, and a dashboard clock. Together, users can establish new identities and preferences in the XYO ecosystem to begin peer-to-peer engagements and be primed for eventual third-party dApp development.</p><p>“Together, we have the power to shape a digital future that is truly our own,” added Arie Trouw. “Whether it’s safely engaging and exchanging with other users in a peer-to-peer manner, or eventually playing secret mini-games for added fun, xyOS is all about enhancing the user experience. No longer shackled by the constraints of centralized platforms, users can explore, create, exchange, and connect with confidence, knowing that those engagements are truly their own.”</p><p>The future of the internet is in our hands, and with xyOS, navigating the online world no longer means leaving our data vulnerable or decentralized technology uncharted.

The DAA aims to bridge the gap between traditional finance and the transformative potential of tokenized real-world assets (RWA) by facilitating connections between the digital asset landscape and traditional financial institutions. Its founding committee includes leaders and visionaries representing top firms and blockchain projects such as DigiFT, Onfet, Tranchess, Banking Circle, and Bright Point International Digital Assets.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.polarismarketresearch.com/industry-analysis/asia-pacific-blockchain-technology-market#:~:text=The%20asia%20pacific%20blockchain%20technology,56.8%25%20during%20the%20forecast%20period.">Polaris Research</a>, the Asia Pacific blockchain market was valued at USD 2.64 billion in 2023 and is expected to expand, with an annual growth rate of 56.8% in the foreseeable future. This growth indicator, coupled with the trillions of dollars of assets <a href="https://www.citigroup.com/global/insights/citigps/money-tokens-and-games">expected</a> to be tokenized by the end of the decade, makes clear that a revolution in blockchain is fast approaching. While asset tokenization is making headway across the world, Asian governments and enterprises are increasingly embracing — and scaling — projects dedicated to asset tokenization as a cornerstone of the new digital economy. Major institutional players in Singapore such as JPMorgan, DBS, and BNY Mellon <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2023/11/15/first-mover-americas-singapore-central-bank-tests-tokenization-alongside-jpmorgan-bny-mellon/">are exploring</a> various RWA use cases.

As a DAA member, XYO and XY Labs eagerly anticipate participating in regulatory discussions and helping to shape policies that encourage innovation and development in this vibrant industry.”</p><p>“The Digital Assets Association is pleased to welcome cutting-edge data sovereignty protocol XYO to the organization,” says Henry Zhang, Founder &amp; CEO of DigiFT, a founding member of DAA. “We are confident that APAC will continue its momentum and further bolster its position as a blockchain hub. The DAA was established to enable the financial services ecosystem to fully capitalize on the immense potential of tokenization, and collaborating with XYO brings DAA one step closer to fulfilling this vision.”</p><p>Here’s a snapshot of XYO’s and XY Labs’ existing involvement in the region:</p><ul><li>XYO’s token is listed on region-leading crypto exchanges such as <a href="https://twitter.com/CoinstoreExc/status/1760873232675328463?t=qGGYiiasocnC6-qiPJeOXg&amp;s=19">Coinstore</a>, <a href="https://crypto.com/exchange/trade/spot/XYO_USDT">Crypto.com</a>, <a href="https://coinw.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/26273376276249-XYO-will-be-listed-on-CoinW-Exchange-on-12-15-2023-11-00-UTC-join-XYO-Welfare-Quartet-Join-to-Share-a-5-000-Prize-Pool">CoinW</a>, <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220110005862/en/Huobi-Lists-XYO-Token-in-Ongoing-Growth-for-Geospatial-Network">HTX,</a> <a href="https://gate.io/trade/xyo_usdt?ref=12312805">Gate.io</a> and <a href="https://www.kucoin.com/trade/XYO-USDT">KuCoin</a>.</li><li>In 2022, XYO launched its $20 million XYO ecosystem fund with Singapore’s <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220210005382/en/%C2%A0XYO-Announces-20-Million-Ecosystem-Fund-In-Partnership-With-Outliers-Fund-to-Expand-XYO-Ecosystem-Oracles-and-Geospatial-Blockchain-Projects">Outliers Fund</a>, expanding into a region where <a href="https://capital.com/xyo-looks-to-singapore-to-expand-its-ecosystem-s-capabilities">crypto adoption surpasses Europe and North America.</a></li><li>XY Labs’ (the company behind the XYO protocol) <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/blockchain-oracle-network-xy-labs-shares-start-trading-at-sec-registered-platform">stock was tokenized and currently trades on the tZERO ATS</a>, which <a href="https://support.xy.company/hc/en-us/articles/5225140524315-What-countries-and-jurisdictions-does-tZERO-support">operates in countries such as China, Hong Kong, South Korea, and Thailand</a>.</li><li>XY’s <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=network.xyo.coin&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US&amp;pli=1">COIN app</a> boasts hundreds of thousands of users in Southeast Asia, where <a href="https://koreablockchainweek.com/blogs/kbw-blog/blockchain-and-crypto-in-southeast-asian-countries">the P2E economy is booming</a> and empowering individuals to gain financial freedom.</li></ul><p>If you’d like to stay updated on XYO’s developments in the APAC, subscribe to our newsletter <a href="https://xyo.network/newsletter">here</a> and follow us on X <a href="https://twitter.com/OfficialXYO">here</a>.</p><p>For all media inquiries, please contact the XYO Press Team at <a href="mailto:XYO@Wachsman.com">XYO@Wachsman.com</a>.</p><p><strong>About XYO</strong></p><p>Established in 2018, XYO’s mission is aimed at restoring individuals’ control over the data they create.

But more importantly, I look at what we didn’t accomplish. Every day, I spend time at my computer, and I think about how I can challenge myself in the pursuit of a more perfect internet. How can we work as a project, <em>as a community,</em> to bring XYO to everyone across the world? How do we create the perfect digital environment for our core values? How do we bring <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/innovation-circle/freedom-unleashed-americans-deserve-the-right-to-own-their-data">true data sovereignty, data provenance, and data permanence</a> to everyone who rightly deserves it?</p><p>XYO stands at the precipice of three, very long years of intense XYO development. In that time, we have grown our incredible team of developers, and we’ve perfected the core technology needed for incoming development atop the XYO Platform. <a href="https://medium.com/xyonetwork/xyo-q1-2023-update-xyo-2-1-2d36b4b2d2fa">XYO 2.0 is ready.</a></p><p><strong>In 2024, we ask you to be ready as well.</strong></p><p>Our 2024 roadmap looks a little different than those you’ve seen in the past. Our changes take into account the biggest strides we’ve made, and they keep in check the stumbles we’ve had, too.</p><p>Some of the biggest changes you’ll notice are:</p><ul><li>The removal of a quarter-based system</li><li>Distinct product maps based on development team</li><li>Brand cohesion and clear product purposes</li></ul><p>We have chosen to deprecate the quarterly system for 2024. It’s a big change, but it’s not an unfamiliar one in the world of tech. This set up allows us to display a clear path for our community without arbitrary, 3-month timelines. Our team-based product mapping offers transparency for the road ahead — where you’ll see growth, and who will be responsible for making that a reality. After a variety of products and even more ahead of us, our 2024 will create brand cohesion and clarity. We’ll be working on more videos, more content and even more ways to integrate XYO into your daily life easily.

The current trajectory of Web3 and blockchain strays further from the original dream of decentralization and sovereignty. Every. Single. Day.</p><p>Why? We are in an unstable and still-developing blockchain industry. In the past few years, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/cryptos-string-bankruptcies-2023-01-20/">some of the mightiest blockchain companies have fallen</a> and many others have failed to find lift-off in the first place. Common pitfalls for Web3 focused companies and projects include:</p><ul><li>Prioritizing shared ledgers as the only approach to Web3</li><li>Obsessing over single use cases like DeFi instead of focusing on various sovereign solutions</li><li>Inability to integrate with existing systems such as app stores, payment platforms, and advertising caused by Web3’s decentralized authority paradigms</li><li>Paralysis caused by the absence of clear laws and governmental rulings leads to sacrificing technology advancements to comply with outdated regulations, stripping their work of the original sovereign intent</li></ul><p>So what’s the result of all this? <strong>Regression</strong>. Companies lean back on Web2 standards and safety nets, resulting in less-than-attractive technological advances. Even many Web3 efforts are pivoting back to centralized control with technologies such as upgradable contracts.</p><p>More than ever, it is imperative to build with the original purpose in mind:</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/xyonetwork/2023-the-year-of-the-self-sovereign-system-cdfa73a36cb0"><strong>Personal digital sovereignty</strong></a><strong> and a Sovereign Internet for the world.</strong></p><h3>Returning to Web3’s Goals</h3><p>At XYO, we have experienced the difficulties a Web2 world presents for Web3 development and growth. Never has it deterred us. Our company has been around since 2012, and our blockchain journey began in early 2018. Since then, we’ve launched numerous Web3 products and weathered many a bear market. Recently, we launched our near-term <a href="https://medium.com/xyonetwork/xyos-plan-for-q4-2023-exploring-exciting-new-features-and-improved-developer-tools-a707bd65c0c1">Q4 2023 Roadmap</a>.</p><p>Our goals for Q4 continue to chart a path back to what Web3 was meant to be: a widespread, open source ecosystem that brings data providers and data consumers together in a mutually beneficial relationship.</p><p>Goals:</p><ul><li>Strong development efforts on technology</li><li>Clear and usable developer documentation</li><li>Smaller, but well-developed solutions that highlight XYO Technology</li><li>Preparation for the upcoming XYO Builder Bounty Program.</li></ul><p>Each of these come together to make Q4 the springboard for an exciting, community-involved 2024. This all starts with large developmental efforts.</p><h3>Developer Documentation &amp; Tools</h3><p>We have already begun working on developer documentation. Docusaurus offers a beautiful and well-known layout that is easy for developers to navigate. Additionally, we’ve already made strides in improving the <a href="https://explore.xyo.network/">Explore</a> and <a href="https://node.xyo.network/">Node</a> website experiences. These sites are primarily useful for developers who need a visual representation of the modules and data they are working with and the relationships between them.</p><h4>docs.xyo.network</h4><p>We’ve fully documented our SDKs, but that is just the beginning. To ensure that everyone can contribute and utilize XYO we’re adding:</p><ul><li>Introduction &amp; Examples</li><li>XYO Ecosystem Glossary &amp; Type Documentation</li><li>XYO Solutions</li></ul><h4>Introduction &amp; Examples</h4><p>An introduction to a new code documentation is always useful. While XYO can be added to nearly any project out there, it still presents a new way of coding and thinking about data. To help guide new XYO developers, an introduction, as well as some practice examples, are slated to be added in Q4 2023. This will help new developers start using XYO on day one, and help them feel more comfortable with ideas like: data as XYO payloads, incorporating XYO modules, building custom modules, and contributing to the development of the XYO Platform.</p><h4>XYO Ecosystem Glossary &amp; Type Documentation</h4><p>It’s important that new XYO developers can consistently rely on our reference documentation. Glossaries provide clarity, reduce confusion, and can be the difference between adoption and abandonment. The XYO Ecosystem Glossary will serve as a way to increase comprehension of XYO terms and a method of reducing the time needed to learn prior to building with an XYO SDK or plug-in.</p><p>Internally, we use Typescript, and it ensures we maintain a clean, accessible, and easy-to-read codebase. Part of this meticulous style of coding means we catch potential type traps early, and we look forward to having this incorporated in our XYO documentation and codebases.</p><h4>XYO Integrations</h4><p>Our documentation plans for Q4 and beyond also include details on how to easily integrate XYO features into existing projects. By using XYO’s technology, you can improve the sovereignty, performance and user experience of your website. Future XYO integrations detailed in the documentation will be things like code examples for features like PermaShare — copy and paste a block of code, and suddenly your existing function can turn your page into a PermaShare link!</p><h4>explore.xyo.network</h4><p><a href="https://explore.xyo.network/">Explore</a> is a treasure trove for anyone wanting to analyze XYO data. On <strong>explore.xyo.network</strong>, you can browse payloads on a public or private archivist, view payload schemas, and see how the XYO modules in your code interact with each other. It also serves as a way for developers to easily visualize what they are building.</p><h4>node.xyo.network</h4><p><a href="https://node.xyo.network/">Node</a> is designed as a way to run an XYO Node on your browser or device. With decentralization and sovereignty at the heart of everything we do, we made Node so that anyone can create and interact with XYO. No setup. No gatekeeping. No barriers.</p><p>Our Builder Bounty program in 2024 (more on that below) could result in quite a few new XYO dApps and module options. When an XYO contributor, codeless or otherwise, wants to use a new dApp that has been created, they can spin up an XYO Node on their computer with <strong>node.xyo.network</strong>, and run that dApp in the resulting digital environment.</p><p>Through node.xyo.network, users will also be able to occasionally complete Builder Bounties. For example, if a request includes running a module on your personal computer, the module will most likely be run within node.xyo.network. You’d visit node.xyo.network, spin up the correct module on your computer, process data or run the module in some way, and return the result.</p><p>Keep reading to learn more about our upcoming XYO solutions and the XYO Builder Bounty Program.</p><h3>PermaShare &amp; Live Sharing</h3><p>Simply put, PermaShare lets you share data with a permanent hash.</p><p>Let’s break it down.</p><h4>The Problem</h4><p>PermaShare solves one of the biggest problems we face today. <strong>Not being able to trust what we see on the internet.</strong></p><p>You know exactly what I mean. We go on the internet daily.<strong> </strong>Each time we find something, we do a mental “checklist” to ensure we can trust the source and the data, itself.</p><p>“<em>Is it shared by a trusted account?”, </em>we ask ourselves. <em>“Cool, it’s got the check mark. But did they just pay for it? How do I know it’s not trying to trick me?” </em>Next, we question the data itself. <em>“Any weird filters or edits in the image or data itself? Wait, is that closed-caption really what [insert politician here] said, or is that edited?”</em> You do this, subconsciously and consciously, every time you see something new.</p><p>It wastes our time, our energy, and our brain power. The tiny bits of frustration build up and affect our outlook on the world. <strong>We need something better.</strong></p><h4>How Audit Trails Affect Our Data Confidence</h4><p>As stated earlier, PermaShare is a hash-based sharing tool. But before we dive into the details of PermaShare, it’s important to understand the underlying technology and the value that comes along with it.</p><p>One of the key differentiators for general blockchain technology is the ability to have an <strong>audit trail.</strong> With the use of cryptographic signatures and blockchain ledgers, you can track the source, or <strong>provenance</strong>, of data without fear of it being invalid or altered. Being able to easily trace the source of data means we just have to ask one question about our data:</p><p><em>Can I trust the original creator of this data?</em></p><p>Once you can trust the source of the data, it’s <strong>easy to establish data confidence</strong> — any time, anywhere.</p><h4>The PermaShare Solution</h4><p>PermaShare makes the process of establishing data confidence easier than ever before<strong>. </strong>It also solves the problem of longevity for shared data — even if a platform goes out of business or you end up <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_banning">shadow-banned</a>, you can always view the data you originally shared.</p><p>Social Media platforms present a beautiful example of just how far-reaching the positive effects of PermaShare can be. Let’s start small.</p><h4>Example #1: Sharing a link on Facebook</h4><p>When you share a link today, the social media site you use <a href="https://zapier.com/blog/what-is-a-cache/">caches</a> the image. Even if the content on the page changes, the social media site will rely on the image they previously saved for that link. Why? It’s useful. Caching can improve performance, visual consistency, and reduce data usage, just to name a few of its perks.</p><p>PermaShare (and XYO) offers the same level of usefulness, but with a “few” extra add-ons: transparency, historical recordkeeping, data authentication, manipulation prevention, verified news, improved user control, and data privacy.</p><h4>Example #2: The Fall of MySpace &amp; Vine</h4><p>Every year, new social platforms pop up. But in most cases, their core data is the same: text, images, videos, links. But each time a new platform launches, there’s always an underlying test of longevity. The worst part is the data loss. Thousands of accounts, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/myspace-data-loss">millions of photos and songs</a>, and a huge blip in the digital global history.</p><p><strong>Instead of mourning the data losses from a dead platform, imagine transferring your entire profile’s history to a new one.</strong></p><p>Transforming social media material to XYO payloads allows users to take control of the data they create on social platforms. Right now, users assume they have ownership over the content they share, but the underlying reliance on Web2&#39;s centralized systems equals instability. Permanent links help maintain the integrity of the content that users originally interacted with. Imagine you had a personal, private website to pull up your old <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myspace">MySpace</a> account, or you could laugh again at a bunch of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vine_(service)">Vines</a>.</p><h4>Using PermaShare for “live” data</h4><p>Live Sharing is the corollary to PermaShare. While it maintains the audit trail and blockchain benefits of PermaSharing, it also allows you to share “live” data.</p><p>This can be anything from the literal “live” score of a popular sports game, the relative value of a US Dollar to the British Pound, or the top 5 coins on <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/xyo/">CoinMarketCap</a>. Live Sharing also solves some of the most annoying problems about sharing today. Here’s an example:</p><p>Robert wants to share a link to his new online business for custom shoes. He shares the link on Facebook, gets some new customers, and life is great! The website homepage Robert shared showcased one of his most popular shoes, and the demand is so high, he has to take it off the site while he waits for shipments. However, <strong>even after updating to a new shoe design on the homepage, the Facebook link doesn’t update the share image! </strong>Suddenly, Robert experiences angry potential customers, who clicked the Facebook link and expected the shoe was available.</p><p><strong>Now, imagine Robert had used an XYO Live Sharing link instead.</strong></p><p>When Robert shares the link to the homepage of his new website, it displays the live products he decides to showcase. When he launches new designs, or has to take some down for shipment delays, the link <strong><em>automatically updates to the new designs he’s trying to sell. </em></strong>Any new customers that end up on Robert’s site from that link have seen a design that is readily available, and they can go ahead and purchase it that day.</p><p>Together, PermaShare and Live Sharing improve something people already interact with every day. But the improvements don’t stop here. Having permanent links with easily accessible audit trails is something every industry needs, whether it’s to better track and authenticate blood glucose levels for diabetes monitoring or Olympic race times. PermaShare offers a single, verifiable, isolated record — anonymity, access, and control is all in the user’s hands. And we’re already using PermaShare internally today.</p><h4>Public &amp; Developer Use</h4><p>We’re already using PermaShare and Live Sharing in several places across our tech stack internally with excellent results. We’re working on bringing these XYO-backed benefits to the community so that everyone can leverage the power of XYO.</p><h3>Builder Bounty Program</h3><p>The XYO Builder Bounty program is slated for early 2024. Bounty programs often focus on bug reports — ethical hackers locate and report issues with software and receive a reward for doing so. With our bounty program, we wanted to primarily promote the contribution to and adoption of XYO technology and still include Bug Bounties only for release code.</p><p>A big focus of the XYO Builder Bounty program is for developers to contribute to the XYO technology and open-source community. We are also considering bounties for non-developers. This means you could get bounties for running codeless tasks, such as running a specific module overnight or computing larger sets of data. During the Builder Bounty Program, this is a manual process, but it will later be replaced with automated payment channels for running nodes that contribute to shared data. These channels will be funded by people using the data, resulting in an automated two sided data marketplace.</p><p>Here’s a Rate My NFT Builder Bounty Example:</p><p><em>Run an XYO Module to generate 10,000 </em><a href="https://foreventory.com/web3/nfts"><em>Rate My NFT</em></a><em> scores to improve the speed of Foreventory.</em></p><p>In this example, we are asking the community to run a pre-coded module that uses your CPU to generate Rate My NFT scores. Why? Because of the collection size! It’s over 10,000 NFTs, so it may take some time to scan, rate, and create payloads for that set of data. After you’ve completed the task, you can share the result with the team, and receive your bounty.</p><p>It may seem like a simple task, but the benefit is huge. After the NFTs have been rated, they can now be more easily accessed as payloads. It’s faster, more efficient, and available for anyone using Rate My NFTs. And of course, the person providing the data or development is rewarded for their completed task.</p><p><strong>Our goal is to have the XYO token serve as a way for the bounty program to start a stable, utility-based economy as we move into 2024.</strong></p><h3>Final Thoughts</h3><p>XYO’s Q4 2023 is bound to be exciting. We have new things lined up for release, and we’ve set our sights on a worthwhile list of upgrades to our technology, setting us up for a paradigm-shifting 2024. We are aiming to alter the course of Web3 development, not just provide incremental improvements predicated on the ideas of others. We expect to have our work redefine how Web3 is envisioned and developed. <strong>The battle for personal, digital, and shared sovereignty is the most important challenge facing society today, and XYO is at the forefront of that battle.</strong></p><p>On a more personal note, I am extremely excited about releasing PermaShare. It not only helps solve ongoing issues that are common on the internet, it also showcases the power of the XYO approach to Web3. Most importantly, it demonstrates that simple tools can drastically improve user security. <strong>Security through transparency is the way of the future.</strong></p><p>The XYO Protocol, Platform, and Ecosystem is the culmination of years of work by myself and the extraordinary team that are here at XY Labs and XYO.</p><p><strong>Make sure you follow me:</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://arietrouw.medium.com/">@arietrouw</a> on Medium</li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/arietrouw">@arietrouw</a> on X (Twitter)</li></ul><p>XYO posts every day to X, Facebook, and Instagram:</p><ul><li><a href="https://twitter.com/OfficialXYO">Follow us on X (Twitter)</a></li><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/OfficialXYO">Follow us on Facebook</a></li><li><a href="https://www.instagram.com/officialxyo/">Follow us on Instagram</a></li></ul><p>Or join our community on <a href="https://discord.gg/officialxyo">Discord</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/xyonetwork">Reddit</a>, or <a href="https://t.me/xyonetwork">Telegram</a>.</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy_Quest">Never give up, never surrender!</a></p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=40f51027b311" width="1" height="1" alt=""><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/xyonetwork/the-downward-spiral-of-web3-40f51027b311">The Downward Spiral of Web3</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/xyonetwork">XYO Network</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

We’re excited to share our plans with you and can’t wait to show you how these developments will revolutionize the XYO ecosystem.</p><p>Keep in mind, this is only the roadmap updates for Q4–2023. The full 2024 roadmap will also be shared in the next few weeks!</p><p><a href="https://xyo.network/roadmap#Q4"><strong>Be sure to check out the updated visual Q4 roadmap on the XYO Website!</strong></a></p><p>But before we venture forth, let’s talk about what’s not on the docket for Q4. As you may have guessed, if you’re familiar with our original 2023 roadmap, some of our most exciting and ambitious plans for 2023 have been bumped to Q1 and Q2 of 2024. This includes our Crypto Cards CCG and the new version of XYO World.</p><p>Wait! Hold your groans, we’re not here to disappoint you today.</p><p>There’s a simple reason for this. Those new products have got to be good, and we’re not going to release them until we’re confident they are. So we’re dedicating Q4 to improving the foundations upon which these products — and indeed the entire XYO ecosystem — are built. Moreover, many of the features queued for Q4 are key features or requirements for our products in 2024. Not only will we be improving the underlying technology, we’ll also be taking critical steps towards making future products a reality.</p><p><strong>Part of this plan includes some <em>really</em> cool stuff we haven’t talked about before.</strong> You’re going to like it, we can pretty much guarantee it. But we’ll get to that in a moment — read on.</p><p>Our most important goal for wrapping up 2023 is to create a stronger foundation for both XYO World (XYOW) and Crypto Cards CCG, not to mention the wider XYO ecosystem. To achieve this, we’ve decided to move the launch of both of these products to the first half of 2024, and first <strong>focus on building core XYO Platform technology required to develop XYO dApps like these including two new XYO features — PermaShare and Live Sharing</strong>.</p><p>These new concepts are key features for both XYOW and Crypto Cards CCG, and we can’t wait to show you how they’ll enhance the user experience for players like you.</p><p><strong>PermaShare</strong> is an XYO Tool that allows you to share a permanent snapshot of a webpage. See a funny typo on CNN’s homepage? Want to share the breaking news article in The New York Times? With PermaShare, you can truly create a permanent snapshot of <em>anything</em> you want to share, and it can never be changed or deleted.</p><p>This may sound similar to projects like the Internet Archive’s <a href="https://archive.org/web/">Wayback Machine</a>. But PermaShare is a critical evolution of the concept. For example, the Wayback Machine doesn’t store images, and as a result, a lot of material is lost. PermaShare, on the other hand, provides a true, image-based or cryptographic data snapshot.</p><p>In contrast, here’s the earliest Wayback Machine snapshot of Whitehouse.gov, from 1996:</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/982/0*5tCwkAtc7wjCNOQo" /></figure><p>Moreover, PermaShare permanently validates the data saved with blockchain cryptography, providing a source and proving that snapshots taken are <em>unaltered</em>. This is the critical provenance the internet needs in the age of digital misinformation and AI.</p><p>PermaShare is a core feature we’ve had planned for XYO World and Crypto Cards all year. In order to share and verify important information from either of those products, we’ll include PermaShare. For example, the outcome of a game of CryptoCards can be verified by anyone with access to the PermaShare snapshot for that battle.</p><p>We’ve decided to release PermaShare as not just a mutual feature of XYO World and Crypto Cards, but as a product unto itself, because its vast array of potential uses demand that it be made easily available to both users and developers. It’s a fantastic on-ramp, a great reason to include XYO into a third party project or product, and it will doubtlessly be included in more XYO products in the future.</p><p>We’re also building out our feature called <strong>Live Sharing</strong>. This won’t be a product on its own, but it will be an important feature of XYO products moving forward and will be included in XYO’s public SDKs.</p><p>It’s already been debuted in Foreventory, and is now in the process of being refined and expanded.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/605/0*KM85PDabrxFBryp_" /></figure><p>This is a little different from the sharing features with which you may be familiar. The data shared is dynamic, and will update when anything changes. For example, in Foreventory, if Descartes begins getting more value out of Netflix than Nietzsche in the future, that will be reflected in the results if anyone visits the shared link.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/939/0*-8itilTqBFF55lOt" /></figure><p>Live Sharing is, simply put, a better way to share mutable data. If you want to share your Crypto Cards score over time, the same share link will always show your most recent statistics. (This synergizes perfectly with PermaShare, which would allow you to share your Live Sharing link at a specific moment in time, proving how much progress you’ve made.)</p><p>Together with COIN, Crypto Cards CCG and XYO World will become the second and third pillars of XYO’s new decentralized gaming ecosystem, which will harness a massive, decentralized network of users and devices to both generate and utilize astonishingly powerful aggregate data.</p><p><strong>But there’s something else we haven’t told you about yet.</strong> Something for which we’re building the foundations. In Q1 2024, we’re introducing the <strong>XYO Builder Bounty Program</strong>.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*E96WypCk_z8fhdbU" /></figure><p>Get ready for our first ever opportunity for fans to supercharge the power of XYO, coming in 2024. We’re giving true enthusiasts like you the chance to directly contribute to building XYO and earn exclusive, specialty rewards. Don’t miss out on the electrifying updates in our upcoming 2024 Roadmap. Stay tuned, it’s dropping soon!</p><p>In service of these goals, our future goals, as well as the wider adoption of XYO, we’re also hard at work revitalizing our <a href="https://xyo.network/developer">developer tools</a>. These tools have been designed to make it easy for developers to build and integrate XYO technology into their own apps and projects. We believe that improving these tools will help us reach a wider audience of developers and enthusiasts who are excited about the possibilities afforded by XYO technology.</p><h3>XYO on Twitter: &quot;A preview of new UI features for XYO&#39;s React JS SDK.

By updating these web apps, we hope to provide users with an even better experience and make it easier than ever for developers to keep XYO up-to-date in their software projects.</p><p>We’ve also <a href="https://medium.com/xyonetwork/xyo-q3-review-a-look-back-at-a-big-quarter-b0d0dbf1ee8a">previously mentioned</a> that there are major, ongoing changes to the XYO SDKs. These changes will augment the same products that PermaShare and Live Sharing have been built to support. By including these features in our public SDKs, we ensure that XYO is as useful as possible for third party developers, and we enable all XYO products to include our best features quickly and efficiently.</p><h3>XYO on Twitter: &quot;XYO SDKs (software development kits) are being updated regularly!

He also shared his thoughts on the possible directions for data sovereignty in the future, both good and bad, with instruction on how we, as users, can steer things in the right direction. <a href="https://medium.com/xyonetwork/data-defines-your-choices-demand-to-own-your-data-with-xyo-aaa1a2b6c0b4">Learn more about data sovereignty here.</a></p><h4><strong>The Data Pipeline and the Power of Knowledge</strong></h4><h3>XYO on Twitter: &quot;Our new data analytics tool, Foreventory, represents a leap forward for personal data sovereignty.

It brought a lot of new eyes to XYO and we made sure new fans were properly introduced to our project and our vision.</p><h4><strong>Foreventory Web3 &amp; NFT Features Enter Alpha</strong></h4><p>Next, our development team launched into the upcoming phase for Foreventory — its much-anticipated web3 features. The first of these will be a Rate My NFTs tool (this is the working title and may not be final), which will allow users to obtain individual quality ratings for NFTs across a number of popular blockchains, or rate a collection in any given wallet or gallery using a sample of the NFTs inside. Quality ratings are based on transparent criteria and each of these criteria are laid out in a breakdown of the overall rating of each NFT.</p><h3>XYO on Twitter: &quot;Will your favorite NFT get a perfect score like this NyanCat piece from @mntge_io and owned by @SnoopDogg? 🤔 #Foreventory pic.twitter.com/fwEBJgADui / Twitter&quot;</h3><p>Will your favorite NFT get a perfect score like this NyanCat piece from @mntge_io and owned by @SnoopDogg? 🤔 #Foreventory pic.twitter.com/fwEBJgADui</p><p>This feature is currently in the alpha phase of testing.

We embraced a new way of working, and it opened new horizons for our team. The core XY Labs team now spans across the country, with partners and contractors around the world.</p><figure><img alt="Blue beach towel with XYO World graphics and the XY Labs logo and name laid out on a stonework bench with an embedded Spanish-style fountain. A yellow cocktail in a plastic cup sits on the towel." src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*4r-XKzWA_7pbdIpj" /></figure><p>This summer we decided to meet up with one another in XYO’s hometown of San Diego. After a wonderful dinner at one of the city’s legendary microbreweries, Arie explained his vision for XYO and its future to the core XY Labs team. The next day, he treated the team to gourmet tacos and a pool party at his beautiful home where we got to truly feel like a team. (Although some of the code nerds among us could not be stopped from working while we were there. We tried.)</p><p>Our minds refreshed, we got back to work.</p><h4><strong>Ongoing SDK Updates</strong></h4><p>Everything XYO does is built on the XYO SDKs. Software Development Kits are the fundamental code which links one project to another, that allow a project to be built on and into XYO. SDKs are the code that defines what XYO is.</p><h3>XYO on Twitter: &quot;XYO SDKs (software development kits) are being updated regularly!

                "<h3>XYO Now Available on Optimism — Faster and Cheaper Transactions for True Crypto Enthusiasts</h3><figure><img alt="XYO IS ON OPTIMISM" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*2K1BQngk-0faGIRKtw_7JQ.png" /></figure><p>A question we commonly receive is whether or not XYO would ever consider a Layer 2 solution for high Ethereum gas prices and slow transaction times.</p><p>Today, we’re proud to announce XYO’s arrival on OP Mainnet! With Optimism, you can expect faster and cheaper XYO token transactions than you’ve ever experienced before. Let’s take a look at what Optimism is, how it can benefit XYO holders like you, and what implications this announcement will have for XYO.</p><h4>What is Optimism?</h4><p>Optimism is a blockchain scaling solution that offers a high-speed, layer-two scaling option for Ethereum. It boosts Ethereum’s capacity to support thousands of transactions per second while reducing gas fees. With the arrival of XYO on the OP Mainnet, crypto enthusiasts can look forward to lightning fast transaction speeds and <em>significantly</em> lower (read: dirt cheap) gas fees.</p><p>Optimism uses rollups to bundle transactions into entire blocks, allowing for quicker processing. This approach is much more efficient than Ethereum’s traditional method of processing transactions individually and offers much-needed relief for traders exhausted with high gas prices, peak hours, sluggish transactions, and costly speed boosts.</p><h3>How to Use Bridge XYO to Optimism and Trade with Uniswap v3</h3><p>We asked resident crypto genius, Ryan, who’s one of the megaminds behind developing COIN, to help make sure you know exactly how to power up your XYO with Optimism!</p><h4>New to Optimism?</h4><p>If you’ve never used Optimism before, you’ll need to bridge some ETH as a deposit onto Optimism, as Optimism uses it for gas, just like Ethereum.</p><p>Helpfully, <strong>Optimism has a </strong><a href="https://app.optimism.io/bridge/deposit"><strong>handy web app</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><ul><li>Click the Connect Wallet button and select your wallet type. We’re using <a href="https://metamask.io/">MetaMask</a>, as always.</li><li>When your wallet opens, allow it to connect with the Optimism app.</li><li>Make sure the interface is set to Ethereum Mainnet and ETH.</li></ul><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*DRVfP1Q6sgaOO9w_lUYa3Q.png" /></figure><ul><li>Select the amount of ETH you want to transfer from Ethereum to Optimism.</li></ul><p>Pro Tip: <strong>Transferring ETH to Optimism from Ethereum is quick, but withdrawing it may not be.</strong> At the time of publication, depositing ETH to OP Mainnet takes only a few minutes, but withdrawing it takes about a week. Only transfer the ETH and XYO you don’t mind not having on Ethereum for a few days!</p><ul><li>Click Review Deposit, then Deposit</li><li>Your wallet will open again for you to confirm the transaction; click confirm. The process will likely take a few minutes, hang tight!</li></ul><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*31AV6f4LUgG-lhO762XSqw.png" /></figure><p><strong>NOTE: Your cryptocurrency is still in your wallet!</strong> It’s moved chains, but has not moved from your wallet. You can toggle between chains within your wallet at any time.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*eSIhzfcb-MRs-yPWTrWGhg.png" /></figure><h4>Using XYO with Optimism</h4><p>Once you have some ETH in your wallet on Optimism, you’ll need to bridge some XYO tokens from the Ethereum to Optimism with a deposit.</p><ul><li>Select the token drop-down on the right of the Deposit interface.</li><li>Select the Custom tab from the pop-up modal.</li><li>Input the XYO token contract address on OP Mainnet:<br><a href="https://optimistic.etherscan.io/token/0x9db118d43069b73b8a252bf0be49d50edbd81fc8"><strong>0x9db118d43069b73b8a252bf0be49d50edbd81fc8</strong></a><strong>.</strong></li><li>Click Add Custom Token.

Approve the transaction from your wallet.</li></ul><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*C5QqnQRNWrba1cjWuNm5fg.png" /></figure><p>Pro Tip: This approval only changes your spending cap. It does not deposit your XYO tokens to OP Mainnet.</p><ul><li>Now, move some XYO tokens from Ethereum to Optimism by entering the amount of XYO you want to deposit and clicking Review Deposit.</li><li>Review the deposit and click Deposit.</li><li>Your wallet will open again — confirm the deposit.</li></ul><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*gKKxs1lfSWOiQGcPAL1Zeg.png" /></figure><p>Once this transaction is complete, you have XYO tokens in your wallet on the OP Mainnet!</p><p>Now, switch your wallet from Ethereum to Optimism. <strong>If you don’t see your XYO in your wallet when it’s switched to Optimism</strong>, be sure to add XYO as a custom token in your wallet. (You’ll need to do this for Optimism even if you’ve already done it for Ethereum!)</p><ul><li>Open your wallet and switch to Optimism by switching networks.</li></ul><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*VpHSleRMpdEReVKJYQqBjg.png" /></figure><ul><li>Find Add Custom Token or Import Token.

Well, not quite the usual way… you’re using Optimism!</p><p><a href="https://app.uniswap.org/add/ETH/0x9db118D43069B73B8a252bF0be49d50Edbd81fc8/3000?chain=optimism">Here’s a convenient link</a> to the XYO/ETH trading pair in Uniswap v3 on Optimism.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*qO5M-DRaI9LiGzGSY3Pt1Q.png" /></figure><p>If you’ve never traded on Uniswap before, not to worry, our good friends at <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/academy/article/how-to-use-uniswap">CoinMarketCap have a step-by-step guide</a>.</p><h4>XYO’s New Era of Improved Trading</h4><p>With XYO arriving on Optimism, crypto enthusiasts can expect not only faster, cheaper transactions, but also an improved trading experience. And the bridge between XYO and Optimism offers a unique opportunity for those seeking liquidity for their crypto assets. Importantly, this leap forward also provides a glimpse into the potential for blockchain technology to transform industries that rely on the quality data provided by XYO.</p><p>It’s an exciting time for XYO, and with advancements like this, we can expect even greater innovation in the years to come.

Now in alpha testing, the <a href="https://xyo.network/roadmap#RoadmapQ1MiniDapp">COIN Location dApp</a> will allow COIN users to not only leverage their data but also access and use it, themselves.</p><figure><img alt="The COIN Location dApp as featured on the official XYO 2023 roadmap." src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*XngEUDoEql2wyeyA" /></figure><p>That’s exciting, but we’re just getting started. We also want to make sure you have that kind of access to all of your data, not just what you generate in our systems. You probably use multiple online services from different companies every single day.</p><p>You should have this kind of back door, VIP access to your data from <em>every possible source</em>.</p><p>Are you wondering why you would want that? What use it might be to you? You’ve probably experienced something a few times in your life. An epiphany that a new product, tool, or service you never knew you needed or wanted is better than you expected, more useful and helpful than you could have imagined. Pretty soon, you wonder how you ever got along without it.</p><p>You’re going to feel that way about <a href="https://foreventory.com/">Foreventory</a>. We’re here to open up a new world of possibilities to you.</p><h3><strong>The Possibilities</strong></h3><p>There’s a good chance you’ve enjoyed the power of your data in the past. One of the best companies in the world for data transparency (we love to see it) is also the biggest music streaming service in the world: Spotify. Not only do they make sure you have convenient access to your Spotify data every single year, they also make it fun and give you a great way to use it.</p><p>Every December, now almost as ubiquitous as Christmas lights and holiday sales, comes Spotify Wrapped. If you’re active on social media at all, you probably see your family and friends posting their favorite music for everyone to see. It’s likely you’ve shared yours, too.</p><figure><img alt="An colorful promotional image from Spotify for Spotify Wrapped 2022, showcasing the popular feature on four mobile phone screens." src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*3zDXdSetKTCcvVQr" /></figure><p>In sharing the data they’ve collected about you with you, in an engaging and useful way, Spotify has created a reliable, annual viral marketing campaign. And not only do you get to enjoy learning about your own music-listening habits, Spotify allows you to make a playlist of your one hundred favorite songs, in the exact order of how much you listened to them.</p><p>This is brilliant. Every company should do this, or so you would think. But they don’t, and that’s where XYO comes in.</p><h3><strong>Benefitting From What’s Already Yours</strong></h3><p>There’s a reason a lot of companies don’t want you to see the data you generate for them. For one thing, they often sell it, and obfuscation makes paying for access more desirable. For another, you might learn too much from your data for their liking.</p><p>That may sound a bit conspiratorial, but it’s true.</p><p>For example, if you use a service and can break down exactly how much it’s costing you relative to how much you’re getting out of it, you might discover you’re not getting much out of it at all. If you find out you’re paying $10 an hour for a video streaming service, the last people who want you to know it is that streaming service.</p><p>If you play an online game, you might be familiar with price obfuscation in the form of currency conversion. The cash shops of multiplayer online games don’t have prices in your native fiat currency. You’ve never paid $15 for a cool mount or skin or power-up. No, you bought a pack of Sparkling Doubloons for a cash price, and then the price you were presented for the Ultra Velociraptor High-Speed Mount was shown in Sparkling Doubloons.</p><figure><img alt="A mobile phone screen shows a colorful image of a game’s cash store, featuring the Ultra Velocirator High-Speed Mount, costing 5000 Sparkling Doubloons." src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/900/0*V6HO7n9iQZDgYJDQ" /></figure><p>This is explicitly so you’d have to stop and figure out how much that mount is actually costing you. Let’s go ahead and do that.</p><p>21,000 Sparkling Doubloons: $149.99</p><p>Ultra Velociraptor High-Speed Mount: 5,000 Sparkling Doubloons</p><p>(150 ÷ 21000) x 5000 = 35.71428571428571</p><p><strong>Actual cost of Ultra Velociraptor High-Speed Mount: $35.72</strong></p><figure><img alt="A brokenhearted Ulta Velociraptor High-Speed Mount cries alone in the rain." src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*bLDV9f1A1S9AOVqx" /><figcaption><em>You still want me, don’t you?</em></figcaption></figure><p>By the way, this pricing isn’t made up. It’s based on a real, very popular online game.</p><p>That’s the power of data when you actually know it, and companies know this data has power. That’s why they intentionally stand between you and your data.</p><p>But there’s a way to get that data. Let’s dive in.</p><h3><strong>You Can Already Access Your Data</strong></h3><p>You just need to know how. Even if you’re not familiar with GDPR, you’ve definitely encountered its repercussions.</p><p>GDPR stands for General Data Protection Regulation. It’s a European Union regulation passed in 2016 and implemented in 2018. The law aims to make sure internet users are aware of how their data is collected, how it’s being used, and who has access to it. Since GDPR was implemented, you’ll have become familiar with this:</p><figure><img alt="The GDPR cookie warning on XYO’s official website." src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/412/0*C9nQbnHDaReGx9Xi" /></figure><p>But that’s not all GDPR does. If you request the data collected by any given company which operates within the EU, they’re compelled to provide it as part of GDPR compliance.</p><p>The European Union is big, with almost 448 million residents. It’s also incredibly wealthy. With a combined GDP of all member nations of 16.6 trillion U.S. dollars in 2022, it consistently represents one of the three largest economies in the world, along with the United States and China.</p><p>Most global companies want to be able to do business in the EU, and doing business in the EU means complying with GDPR. Consequently, most companies that have online services have a way to request your data from them. And you can make this request whether you’re in the EU or not.</p><p>But if you’ve ever done so, you may have noticed there’s a problem. The output tends to be raw data. There’s little context and not much you can do with it.</p><figure><img alt="A raw JSON file shown in Microsoft Visual Studio Code." src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*yXooyFch_b8y_TZP" /><figcaption><em>Oh yes, very helpful, thank you.</em></figcaption></figure><p>This doesn’t look like much, but with the right tool, it can be turned into something amazing. Your raw data can power graphs, playlists, head-to-head comparisons, cost analyses, productivity tracking, and more. It can be used to help you manage your life, your free time, your productive time, your family, your household, or your business. It can even, believe it or not, be a lot of fun to use.</p><h4><strong>We’ve created </strong><a href="https://foreventory.com/"><strong>that tool</strong></a><strong>, and now we want you to try it.</strong></h4><h3>Foreventory</h3><figure><img alt="A Foreventory promotional image featuring colorful cartoon versions of its features." src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*bTx7KDJz7D7tGBpv" /><figcaption>Visit <a href="https://foreventory.com/">Foreventory.com</a> to try it!</figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://medium.com/xyonetwork/xyo-proudly-introduces-foreventory-the-worlds-most-powerful-data-analytics-tool-for-everyday-c8c92769b7b9"><strong>XYO’s new web app, Foreventory, the world’s first decentralized data analytics tool for everyday data</strong></a>, will show you how powerful your data is, and perhaps most importantly, transform how you interact with the data you’re already generating across multiple platforms.
